# SQL-Basics-Superstore-Analysis-Task-3
This project is part of a Data Analyst Internship – Task 3, focused on building a strong foundation in SQL basics such as filtering, sorting, aggregations, and grouping using a real-world sales dataset.  The SuperStore Sales dataset was imported into a SQL database and analyzed using structured queries to generate meaningful summaries.

# Tools & Technologies
- MySQL Workbench

# Dataset Used
- SuperStore_Sales.csv
- Contains order, customer, product, sales, and profit information.

# SQL Queries Performed
- The following SQL concepts were covered as required in the task:

# Basic Queries
- SELECT * to understand data structure
- DISTINCT to identify unique categories

# Filtering & Sorting
- WHERE clause for filtering (e.g., Technology category)
- ORDER BY for sorting sales in descending order

# Aggregations & Grouping
- SUM(sales) for total sales
- AVG(profit) for average profit
- COUNT(*) for total orders
- GROUP BY category, region, and segment

# HAVING Clause
- Filtered aggregated results (e.g., categories with total sales > 100000)

# Advanced Conditions
- BETWEEN for date range filtering
- LIKE for customer name pattern search

# Business Query
- Identified Top 5 customers by total sales

# Deliverables
- queries_task3.sql (All queries are documented in)
- sales_summary.csv (Output Files)

# Final Outcome
- This task helped build a solid foundation in SQL for Data Analysis, preparing for more advanced querying and real-world analytics tasks.
